# HuffmanCoding

Huffman coding algorithm implementation with simple unit tests.

## Performance

This implementation was based on [Huffman Coding | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kNXhFIEd_w) youtube video.

The time complexy for building Huffman's tree is `O(n * log(n))`, where `n` is the number of unique characters. Once the tree is built, encoding and decoding are performed in linear time, `O(m)`, where `m` is the input text's length.
